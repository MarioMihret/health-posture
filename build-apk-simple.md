# Build APK Without Android Studio

## Quick Solution: Use Codemagic (FREE)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
2. **Go to**: https://codemagic.io/start/
3. **Sign up** with GitHub (free tier available)
4. **Connect your repository**
5. **Click "Start new build"**
6. **Download the APK** when ready!

## Alternative: PWA to APK Converter

Since you have a web build:

1. **Deploy your web app** (to Vercel/Netlify)
2. **Use PWA Builder**: https://www.pwabuilder.com/
   - Enter your web app URL
   - Click "Build My PWA"
   - Download Android package

## Manual SDK Setup (No Android Studio)

If you want to build locally:

### Step 1: Download SDK Tools
```powershell
# Download link (150MB only):
https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only
```

### Step 2: Extract & Setup
```powershell
# Extract to: C:\Users\mf\android-sdk\cmdline-tools\latest\

# Install required packages:
cd C:\Users\mf\android-sdk\cmdline-tools\latest\bin
.\sdkmanager --install "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"

# Accept licenses:
.\sdkmanager --licenses
```

### Step 3: Build APK
```powershell
# In your project directory:
flutter build apk --release
```

## Recommended: Use Web Version Instead!

Your web build at `build/web` is ready and works on all devices:
- No installation needed
- Works on iOS and Android
- Easier to share and update
- Add to home screen for app-like experience
